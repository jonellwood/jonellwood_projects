Why does everyone seem to make a Pokedex app when learning how to interact with API's? Because it is so much fun!

My attempt at it can be found [here](https://hopeful-shannon-20857d.netlify.app/).

This was a great learning experience using the Pokemon API but good exposure to Redux as well. And I like the styling I did on it as well.
