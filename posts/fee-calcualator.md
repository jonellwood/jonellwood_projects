This project was originally completed it Python but I found it a challenge to make available as a web app so I ported it JavaScript. This is a JS based web app running on a WordPress Site. The calculation logic was by far the most complex part of the project. Fees are calculated on a total revenue where each “section” of revenue (i.e. first million, second million, etc.) have their own rate to reach a total - all of which is predicated on the class of entity paying the fee. Once that was sorted the rest was easy.
