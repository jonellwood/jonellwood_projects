I was asked to create a very simple blog site where updates regarding a long term project could be posted. The requirements were that it be simple to use, fast to load, and allow users to add blog posts without assistance. I opted for a Gatsby site with Sanity as the CMS. I am not responsible for the content nor the frequency of the content posting (just saying)

You can see the ongoing project in production [here](https://hanahanparks.com/).
