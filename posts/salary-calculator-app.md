title: "Salary Calculator App using vanilla JS"

One day while installing a printer at a new workstation I watched a conversation between two managers discussing a coming years budget and salary increases for employees. The pay scale has 13 pay grades and each grade has 12 steps.

The discussion involved a lot of "move them up this step means "X" increase" or "what if we move them up one step but down two grades?" - stuff like that.

And each and every time they would then consult a printed spreadsheet with the hourly rate for each grade and step and calculate out what the annual amount would be and then compare it to the current grade.

Using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I built a small calculator application that allows the selection of a grade and step for salaries 1 & 2 and then just return the rates, the annual amounts for each as well as the difference. The reduction in errors as well as time savings it provides I can only imagine.

You can see a demo version of the project [here](https://wynettedegroot.com/).
